# netcode.io

**netcode.io** is a simple connection-oriented protocol built on top of UDP. 

It's designed for client server/games with dedicated servers, like first person shooters.

It has the following features:

* Token system so only authenticated clients can connect to your server.
* Packets sent between clients and server are encrypted and signed.

And it's secure by design:

* Protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
* Protection against DDoS amplification attacks.
* Protection against packet replay attacks.
* Protection against zombie clients.

Save yourself some time by using netcode.io instead of writing and testing all this yourself!

# How does it work?

Please refer to the second half of this whitepaper: [Why can't I send UDP packets from a browser?](http://gafferongames.com/post/why_cant_i_send_udp_packets_from_a_browser/) 

For a complete technical specification, read the [netcode 1.02 standard](https://github.com/networkprotocol/netcode.io/blob/master/STANDARD.md).
